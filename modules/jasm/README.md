# Just Another Social Module (JASM)
Many social modules exist that allow users to share and/or publish your content to various third-party sites and services. In the information age, more and more companies are adopting social media as a means to promote themselves and/or to engage with peers and customers alike. JASM provides a single place to configure and subsequently promote your site's presence on other sites, like your company's Facebook page, or your company's Twitter feed.
JASM Feature highlights

*  Generates a block with a list of services your site can link to, with class-names for easy theming (e.g a Facebook icon).
*  Generate a list of services (sorted by weight) with a page template variable ($jasm_service_list)
